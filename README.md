# 9_14_16_RustDocumentationworkingthrough
hi Rust

I'm part of a Rust group that meets monthly. I'm going through the documentation on my own
as a warm up for this evening.

update: So I'm actually working through the Rust documentation, and adding some of my own code
        as I go along, to help me understand the language. I've also been realizing that I need
        to do a brush up and continue learning C++ for some of this to make sense, so there will
        be bits of C++ and Haskell also upcoming in other repos.
